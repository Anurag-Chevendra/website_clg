# website_clg

Just a website to facilitate the entire lending and borrowing book process systematically(hopefully).

## Setting up the Environment:
The entire project (as of now) is being hosted on a local server. I am using XAMPP since it comes with APACHE, SQL and many more modules. 

In order to install XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

Also, the HTML CSS is very poor as we are mainly focusing on developing the logic. I hope our goal is achieved within the month to come.
